# Vizualisation part 

For this part, I used the data from [Data Montpellier 3M](http://data.montpellier3m.fr/dataset/comptages-velo-et-pieton-issus-des-eco-compteurs/resource/75f5e367-99fb-482f-ba5c) to visualize the bike traffic in Montpellier. 

## Description

I created an interactive map of Montpellier, where I used the coordinates of each bike counting station to place them on this map. Then I identified each counting station with its name label and drew circles that grow in size and change colour according to the intensity of the traffic. Finally, I added a slider to visualise the evolution of the bike traffic over time.
